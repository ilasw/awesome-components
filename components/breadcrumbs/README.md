## What is

Breadcrumbs are a secondary navigation aid that helps users understand the site hierarchy for the current page. 
It shows the relation between the current page and the higher level pages (a category page, for instance). 
The term takes inspiration from the tale of Hansel and Gretel where the kids drop a trail of breadcrumbs to trace their way back.
